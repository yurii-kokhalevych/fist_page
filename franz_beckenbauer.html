                Franz Anton Beckenbauer (born 11 September 1945) is a German former professional 
                footballer and manager. Early in his playing career he was nicknamed Der Kaiser 
                ("The Emperor") because of his elegant style, dominance and leadership on the field,
                and also as his first name "Franz" is reminiscent of the Austrian emperors. He is
                widely regarded to be one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.
                A versatile player who started out as a midfielder, Beckenbauer made his name as 
                a central defender. He is often credited as having invented the role of the modern
                sweeper or libero.<br> Twice named European Footballer of the Year, Beckenbauer 
                appeared 103 times for West Germany and played in three FIFA World Cups. He is 
                one of only two men, along with Brazil's Mário Zagallo, to have won the World Cup 
                as a player and as a manager; he lifted the World Cup trophy as captain in 1974, 
                and repeated the feat as a manager in 1990. He was the first captain to lift the 
                World Cup and European Championship at international level and the European Cup 
                at club level. He was named in the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, the 
                FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, and in 2004 was listed in the FIFA 100 of the
                world's greatest living players.<br> At club level with Bayern Munich, Beckenbauer 
                won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1967 and three consecutive European Cups from 
                1974 to 1976. The latter feat made him the only player to win three European 
                Cups as captain of his club. He became team manager and later president of 
                Bayern Munich. After two spells with the New York Cosmos he was inducted into 
                the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame.<br> Today, Beckenbauer remains an 
                influential figure in both German and international football. He led Germany's 
                successful bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup and chaired the organizing 
                committee. He currently works as a pundit for Sky Germany and is a columnist 
                for the tabloid Bild.

                <h4>Club career</h4>
                Beckenbauer made his debut with Bayern in the Regionalliga Süd ("Regional League 
                South", then the second level in Germany) on the left wing against Stuttgarter 
                Kickers on 6 June 1964. In his first season in the regional league, 1964–65, 
                the team won promotion to the recently formed Bundesliga, the national league.
                Bayern soon became a force in the new German league, winning the German Cup in
                1966–67 and achieving European success in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1967. 
                Beckenbauer became team captain for the 1968–69 season and led his club to their 
                first league title. He began experimenting with the sweeper (libero) role around
                this time, refining the role into a new form and becoming perhaps the greatest 
                exponent of the attacking sweeper game.<br>Beckenbauer with the Club Cipolletti 
                players during a match played in Argentina in 1980 During Beckenbauer's tenure 
                at Bayern Munich, the club won three league championships in a row from 1972 to 
                1974 and also a hat-trick of European Cup wins (1974–76) which earned the club 
                the honour of keeping the trophy permanently. Interestingly, since 1968 
                Beckenbauer, has been called Der Kaiser by fans and the media.<br> 
                The following anecdote is told (even by Beckenbauer himself) to explain the
                origin: On the occasion of a friendly game of Bayern Munich in Vienna, Austria, 
                Beckenbauer posed for a photo session right beside a bust of the former Austrian 
                emperor Franz Joseph I. The media called him Fußball-Kaiser (football-emperor) 
                afterwards, soon after he was just called Der Kaiser. However, according to a 
                report in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, this explanation is untrue, 
                though very popular. According to the report, Beckenbauer fouled his opposite 
                number, Reinhard Libuda from Schalke 04, in the cup final on 14 June 1969. 
                Disregarding the fans' hooting, Beckenbauer took the ball into the opposite 
                part of the field, where he balanced the ball in front of the upset fans for 
                half a minute. Libuda was commonly called König von Westfalen (king of 
                Westphalia), so the press looked for an even more exalted moniker and 
                invented Der Kaiser.<br> In 1977, Beckenbauer accepted a lucrative contract 
                to play in the North American Soccer League with the New York Cosmos. He 
                played with the Cosmos for four seasons up to 1980, and the team won the 
                Soccer Bowl on three occasions ('77, '78, '80).<br> Beckenbauer retired 
                after a two-year spell with Hamburger SV in Germany (1980–82) with the 
                win of the Bundesliga title that year and one final season with the New 
                York Cosmos in 1983. In his career in domestic leagues, he made 587 
                appearances and scored 81 goals.

                <h4>International career</h4>
            <p>
                Beckenbauer won 103 caps and scored 14 goals for West Germany. He was a member of the World Cup squads that finished runners-up in 1966, third place in 1970, and champions in 1974, while also being named to the tournament all-star team in all three editions. He also won the 1972 European Football Championship and finished as runners-up in the 1976 edition. Beckenbauer's first game for the national team came on 26 September 1965.
