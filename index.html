            <p class="history"> The contemporary history of the world's favourite 
            game spans more than 100 years. It all began in 1863 in England, when rugby 
            football and association football branched off on their different 
            courses and the Football Association in England was formed - becoming 
            the sport's first governing body.<br>
            Both codes stemmed from a common root and both have a long and 
            intricately branched ancestral tree. A search down the centuries 
            reveals at least half a dozen different games, varying to different 
            degrees, and to which the historical development of football has 
            been traced back. Whether this can be justified in some instances 
            is disputable. Nevertheless, the fact remains that people have 
            enjoyed kicking a ball about for thousands of years and there is 
            absolutely no reason to consider it an aberration of the more 
            'natural' form of playing a ball with the hands.<br>
            On the contrary, apart from the need to employ the legs and feet 
            in tough tussles for the ball, often without any laws for protection, 
            it was recognised right at the outset that the art of controlling the 
            ball with the feet was not easy and, as such, required no small measure 
            of skill. The very earliest form of the game for which there is scientific 
            evidence was an exercise from a military manual dating back to the second 
            and third centuries BC in China.<br>
            This Han Dynasty forebear of football was called Tsu' Chu and it 
            consisted of kicking a leather ball filled with feathers and hair 
            through an opening, measuring only 30-40cm in width, into a small 
            net fixed onto long bamboo canes. According to one variation of 
            this exercise, the player was not permitted to aim at his target 
            unimpeded, but had to use his feet, chest, back and shoulders while 
            trying to withstand the attacks of his opponents. Use of the hands 
            was not permitted.<br>
            Another form of the game, also originating from the Far East, was 
            Japanese Kemari, which began some 500-600 years later and is still 
            played today. This is a sport lacking the competitive element of 
            Tsu' Chu with no struggle for possession involved. Standing in a 
            circle, the players had to pass the ball to each other, in a 
            relatively small space, trying not to let it touch the ground.<br>
            The Greek 'Episkyros' - of which few concrete details survive - was 
            much livelier, as was the Roman 'Harpastum'. The latter was played 
            out with a smaller ball by two teams on a rectangular field marked 
            by boundary lines and a centre line. The objective was to get the 
            ball over the opposition's boundary lines and as players passed it 
            between themselves, trickery was the order of the day. The game 
            remained popular for 700-800 years, but, although the Romans took 
            it to Britain with them, the use of feet was so small as to scarcely 
            be of consequence.
